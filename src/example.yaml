        # Items in a group are entered with a multi-line string. This is based on the
        # assumption the most of the data comes from some kind of spreadsheet,
        # and allows simply copy-pasting from a CSV file. The required format is:
        #
        # Name used for the label, delimiter (either semicolon or tab character), path to the image file
        #
        # This allows using Windows paths with backslashes but means no escaping is performed!
        # In the output file the backslashes will be replaced with a forward slash.
        #
        # Note that YAML mandates multiline string to be properly indented!
        # This is inconvenient, so using TOML instead is advised.
